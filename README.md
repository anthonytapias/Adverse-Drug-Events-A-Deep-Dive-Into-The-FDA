# Beyond The FDA: Drug-Related Adverse Events in 2017


## Introduction
We have built an exploratory web application (rendered via Dash) that allow users to get information about FDA-regulated drugs (and their reactions) that were involved in "Adverse Events" reported to the FDA across different US holidays in 2017. Users are able to choose statistics generated from a pre-defined set of SQLAlchemy queries and their accompanying visualizations.

The [FDA](https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/fpdwidgets/2e01da82-13fe-40e0-8c38-4da505737e36.html) defines Adverse Events (AE) as "...any symptom that occurs while taking a drug, which may or may not have been caused by the drug. This is different from an adverse drug reaction (ADR), where there is specific evidence that the AE is related to the drug. A side effect is the same as an ADR. As a result, ADR is always an AE, but an AE may or may not be an ADR."

Some questions that our app might help answers include:
- What were the most common drugs involved with adverse events during the holidays in 2017?
- What were the most common reactions reported during Adverse Events?
- On which holidays were the most deaths, suicides, and attempted suicides reported?
